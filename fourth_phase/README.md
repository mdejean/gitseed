We're snuggly inside gitlab now.

There's some huge improvements here:

* We can now run things inside docker images (but not quite yet!)
* We can run things in parallel and clearly visualize and debug them
* The development process in this stage is hugely more streamlined!

However we have a serious problem. This is NOT the final form of gitlab.

I'm not sure what we will do for this stage. First I'll need to approach it.
